\caption{Comparison of classifications obtained using cohort based normalisation and \hemaClass{}.
The classifications are compared in terms of accuracy, Cohen's $\kappa$, and Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$ all supplied with 95\% CIs.
The comparisons in the first and last three columns are based on the one-by-one normalisation method and the reference based normalisation method, respectively.\label{tab:classALL}}
