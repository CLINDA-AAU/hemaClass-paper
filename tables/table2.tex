\caption{Comparison of ABC/GCB classification performed using Wright's method and the established classifier based on cohort normalisation for both.
The first column shows the rate of agreement between the classifiers with 95\% CI.
The second column shows the Cohen's $\kappa$ with 95\% CI.\label{tab:ABCGCBclassifier}}
