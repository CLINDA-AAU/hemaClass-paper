abstract = {PURPOSE: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is widely used for risk stratification of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The introduction of rituximab has markedly improved outcome, and R-CHOP (rituximab + cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) has become the standard treatment for CD20(+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. To investigate whether the IPI has maintained its power for risk stratification when rituximab is combined with CHOP, we analyzed the prognostic relevance of IPI in three prospective clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 1,062 patients treated with rituximab were included (MabThera International Trial [MInT], 380 patients; dose-escalated regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone (MegaCHOEP) trial, 72 patients; CHOP + rituximab for patients older than age 60 years [RICOVER-60] trial, 610 patients). A multivariate proportional hazards modeling was performed for single IPI factors under rituximab on event-free, progression-free, and overall survival. RESULTS: IPI score was significant for all three end points. Rituximab significantly improved treatment outcome within each IPI group resulting in a quenching of the Kaplan-Meier estimators. However, IPI was a significant prognostic factor in all three end points and the ordering of the IPI groups remained valid. The relative risk estimates of single IPI factors and their order in patients treated with R-CHOP were similar to those found with CHOP. CONCLUSION: The effects of rituximab were superimposed on the effects of CHOP with no interactions between chemotherapy and antibody therapy. These results demonstrate that the IPI is still valid in the R-CHOP era.},

abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70\% versus 12\%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.},

Although screening programmes including the implementation of faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy might be able to reduce mortality by removing precursor lesions and by making diagnosis at an earlier stage, the burden of disease and mortality is still high. Improvement of diagnostic and treatment options increased staging accuracy, functional outcome for early stages as well as survival. Although high quality surgery is still the mainstay of curative treatment, the management of CRC must be a multi-modal approach performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary expert team. Optimal choice of the individual treatment modality according to disease localization and extent, tumour biology and patient factors is able to maintain quality of life, enables long-term survival and even cure in selected patients by a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment decisions must be based on the available evidence, which has been the basis for this consensus conference-based guideline delivering a clear proposal for diagnostic and treatment measures in each stage of rectal and colon cancer and the individual clinical situations. This ESMO guideline is recommended to be used as the basis for treatment and management decisions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma after chemotherapy is influenced by molecular features of the tumors. We used the gene-expression profiles of these lymphomas to develop a molecular predictor of survival. METHODS: Biopsy samples of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma from 240 patients were examined for gene expression with the use of DNA microarrays and analyzed for genomic abnormalities. Subgroups with distinctive gene-expression profiles were defined on the basis of hierarchical clustering. A molecular predictor of risk was constructed with the use of genes with expression patterns that were associated with survival in a preliminary group of 160 patients and was then tested in a validation group of 80 patients. The accuracy of this predictor was compared with that of the international prognostic index. RESULTS: Three gene-expression subgroups--germinal-center B-cell-like, activated B-cell-like, and type 3 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma--were identified. Two common oncogenic events in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, bcl-2 translocation and c-rel amplification, were detected only in the germinal-center B-cell-like subgroup. Patients in this subgroup had the highest five-year survival rate. To identify other molecular determinants of outcome, we searched for individual genes with expression patterns that correlated with survival in the preliminary group of patients. Most of these genes fell within four gene-expression signatures characteristic of germinal-center B cells, proliferating cells, reactive stromal and immune cells in the lymph node, or major-histocompatibility-complex class II complex. We used 17 genes to construct a predictor of overall survival after chemotherapy. This gene-based predictor and the international prognostic index were independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays can be used to formulate a molecular predictor of survival after chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

abstract = {Constitutive activation of the nuclear factor-$\kappa$ B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway is a hallmark of the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Recurrent mutations of NF-$\kappa$B regulators that cause constitutive activity of this oncogenic pathway have been identified. However, it remains unclear how specific target genes are regulated. We identified the atypical nuclear I$\kappa$B protein I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ to be upregulated in ABC compared with germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL primary patient samples. Knockdown of I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ by RNA interference was toxic to ABC but not to GCB DLBCL cell lines. Gene expression profiling after I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ knockdown demonstrated a significant downregulation of a large number of known NF-$\kappa$B target genes, indicating an essential role of I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ in regulating a specific set of NF-$\kappa$B target genes. To further investigate how I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ mediates NF-$\kappa$B activity, we performed immunoprecipitations and detected a physical interaction of I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ with both p50 and p52 NF-$\kappa$B subunits, indicating that I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ interacts with components of both the canonical and the noncanonical NF-$\kappa$B pathway in ABC DLBCL. Collectively, our data demonstrate that I$\kappa$B-$\zeta$ is essential for nuclear NF-$\kappa$B activity in ABC DLBCL, and thus might represent a promising molecular target for future therapies.},

Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker.

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by variable clinical outcomes. Outcome prediction at the time of diagnosis is of paramount importance. Previously, we constructed a 6-gene model for outcome prediction of DLBCL patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapies. However, the standard therapy has evolved into rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). Herein, we evaluated the predictive power of a paraffin-based 6-gene model in R-CHOP-treated DLBCL patients. RNA was successfully extracted from 132 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Expression of the 6 genes comprising the model was measured and the mortality predictor score was calculated for each patient. The mortality predictor score divided patients into low-risk (below median) and high-risk (above median) subgroups with significantly different overall survival (OS; P = .002) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = .038). The model also predicted OS and PFS when the mortality predictor score was considered as a continuous variable (P = .002 and .010, respectively) and was independent of the IPI for prediction of OS (P = .008). These findings demonstrate that the prognostic value of the 6-gene model remains significant in the era of R-CHOP treatment and that the model can be applied to routine FFPE tissue from initial diagnostic biopsies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several gene-expression signatures can be used to predict the prognosis in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, but the lack of practical tests for a genome-scale analysis has restricted the use of this method. METHODS: We studied 36 genes whose expression had been reported to predict survival in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. We measured the expression of each of these genes in independent samples of lymphoma from 66 patients by quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction analyses and related the results to overall survival. RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, genes were ranked on the basis of their ability to predict survival. The genes that were the strongest predictors were LMO2, BCL6, FN1, CCND2, SCYA3, and BCL2. We developed a multivariate model that was based on the expression of these six genes, and we validated the model in two independent microarray data sets. The model was independent of the International Prognostic Index and added to its predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the expression of six genes is sufficient to predict overall survival in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix GeneChip typically contains multiple probe sets per gene, defined as sibling probe sets in this study. These probe sets may or may not behave similar across treatments. The most appropriate way of consolidating sibling probe sets suitable for analysis is an open problem. We propose the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) framework to decide which sibling probe sets can be consolidated. RESULTS: The ANOVA model allows us to separate the sibling probe sets into two types: those behave similarly across treatments and those behave differently across treatments. We found that consolidation of sibling probe sets of the former type results in large increase in the number of differentially expressed genes under various statistical criteria. The approach to selecting sibling probe sets suitable for consolidating is implemented in R language and freely available from http://research.stowers-institute.org/hul/affy/. CONCLUSION: Our ANOVA analysis of sibling probe sets provides a statistical framework for selecting sibling probe sets for consolidation. Consolidating sibling probe sets by pooling data from each greatly improves the estimates of a gene expression level and results in identification of more biologically relevant genes. Sibling probe sets that do not qualify for consolidation may represent annotation errors or other artifacts, or may correspond to differentially processed transcripts of the same gene that require further analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {The 4(th) edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues published in 2008 builds upon the success of the 2001 3(rd) edition; new entities are defined, and solutions for problematic categories are sought. Recent studies have drawn attention to the biological overlap between classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Similarly, there is a greater appreciation of the borderlands between Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL. Strategies for the management of these borderline lesions are proposed. Additionally, age-specific and site-specific factors play an important role in the definition of several new entities, which also have biological underpinnings. Among the peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), more precise definitions were introduced for several entities, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Several new variants of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are proposed. Finally, the subclassification and categorization of the most common lymphoma subtypes, follicular lymphoma (FL) and DLBCL, were altered to enhance diagnostic accuracy and aid in clinical management. The 2008 WHO classification also draws attention to early events in lymphomagenesis. These lesions help delineate the earliest steps in neoplastic transformation and generally mandate a conservative therapeutic approach. The 2001 classification was rapidly adopted for clinical trials and successfully served as a common language for scientists comparing genetic and functional data. The modifications made in the 2008 classification are the result of this successful partnership among pathologists, clinicians, and biologists, but are only a stepping stone to the future.},

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In this technology each gene is typically represented by a set of 11-20 pairs of probes. In order to obtain expression measures it is necessary to summarize the probe level data. Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models. In particular, improvements in the ability to detect differentially expressed genes are demonstrated.},

abstract = {Different microarray techniques recently have been successfully used to investigate useful information for cancer diagnosis at the gene expression level due to their ability to measure thousands of gene expression levels in a massively parallel way. One important issue is to improve classification performance of microarray data. However, it would be ideal that influential genes and even interpretable rules can be explored at the same time to offer biological insight. Introducing the concepts of system design in software engineering, this paper has presented an integrated and effective method (named X-AI) for accurate cancer classification and the acquisition of knowledge from DNA microarray data. This method included a feature selector to systematically extract the relative important genes so as to reduce the dimension and retain as much as possible of the class discriminatory information. Next, diagonal quadratic discriminant analysis (DQDA) was combined to classify tumors, and generalized rule induction (GRI) was integrated to establish association rules which can give an understanding of the relationships between cancer classes and related genes. Two non-redundant datasets of acute leukemia were used to validate the proposed X-AI, showing significantly high accuracy for discriminating different classes. On the other hand, I have presented the abilities of X-AI to extract relevant genes, as well as to develop interpretable rules. Further, a web server has been established for cancer classification and it is freely available at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/xai.htm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop novel therapies for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to identify biomarkers predictive for therapeutic response. Lenalidomide was previously shown to induce an overall response rate (ORR) of 28\% in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. It is currently unknown if response rates differ between patients with different DLBCL subtypes. METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes of patients with germinal center B-cell-like versus nongerminal center B-cell-like DLBCL treated with salvage lenalidomide at 4 academic institutions. RESULTS: Forty patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL were included (24 men; 16 women; median age, 66 years; median of 4 prior treatments, including rituximab chemotherapy). Patients were classified as germinal center B-cell-like (n = 23) or nongerminal center B-cell-like (n = 17) DLBCL according to the Hans algorithm. The subgroups were similar in terms of stage, international prognostic index score, prior number of treatments, and rituximab resistance. A significant difference in clinical response to lenalidomide was observed in nongerminal center B-cell-like versus germinal center B-cell-like patients. ORR was 52.9\% versus 8.7\% (P = .006); complete response rate was 23.5\% versus 4.3\%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 versus 1.7 months (P = .004), although no difference in OS was observed between nongerminal center B-cell-like and germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the 2 major subgroups of patients with DLBCL (germinal center B cell and nongerminal center B cell) have different antitumor responsiveness to lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting. A large international trial (NCT01197560) has been opened to enrollment in an attempt to prospectively validate these retrospective observations.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be divided into prognostically important subgroups with germinal center B-cell-like (GCB), activated B-cell-like (ABC), and type 3 gene expression profiles using a cDNA microarray. Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks were created from 152 cases of DLBCL, 142 of which had been successfully evaluated by cDNA microarray (75 GCB, 41 ABC, and 26 type 3). Sections were stained with antibodies to CD10, bcl-6, MUM1, FOXP1, cyclin D2, and bcl-2. Expression of bcl-6 (P <.001) or CD10 (P =.019) was associated with better overall survival (OS), whereas expression of MUM1 (P =.009) or cyclin D2 (P <.001) was associated with worse OS. Cases were subclassified using CD10, bcl-6, and MUM1 expression, and 64 cases (42\%) were considered GCB and 88 cases (58\%) non-GCB. The 5-year OS for the GCB group was 76\% compared with only 34\% for the non-GCB group (P <.001), which is similar to that reported using the cDNA microarray. Bcl-2 and cyclin D2 were adverse predictors in the non-GCB group. In multivariate analysis, a high International Prognostic Index score (3-5) and the non-GCB phenotype were independent adverse predictors (P <.0001). In summary, immunostains can be used to determine the GCB and non-GCB subtypes of DLBCL and predict survival similar to the cDNA microarray.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment of young patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains a matter of debate and requires improvement. The combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) with addition of etoposide (CHOEP) has in other patient groups been shown to be effective. Further improvement has been accomplished with the use of rituximab in combination with the regimens every 2 weeks (R-CHOP-14, R-CHOEP-14). The aim of the present retrospective population-based study was to compare R-CHOP-14 with R-CHOEP-14 in a cohort of high-risk patients aged 18-60 years with two or more risk factors (stage III-IV, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, performance status 2-4). To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing these two regimens in this patient group. METHODS: We obtained data for the period 2004-2009 from the Danish Lymphoma Database. One hundred and fifty-nine patients were eligible to enter the study. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) and secondary end points were response to treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. RESULTS: Four-year OS was superior in the R-CHOEP-14 group: 75\% compared with 62\% for R-CHOP-14 (P=0.04). This superiority was also seen for PFS: 4-year PFS was 70\% for the R-CHOEP-14 group compared with 58\% for the R-CHOP-14 group (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: R-CHOEP-14 is a promising regimen for young patients with high-risk DLBCL with improved OS and PFS compared with R-CHOP-14.},

abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a powerful tool for implicating novel gene ensembles in cellular mechanisms of health and disease. The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals approximately 30-50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe set definitions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 B-cell antigen, has therapeutic activity in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a randomized trial to compare CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab with CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, 60 to 80 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either eight cycles of CHOP every three weeks (197 patients) or eight cycles of CHOP plus rituximab given on day 1 of each cycle (202 patients). RESULTS: The rate of complete response was significantly higher in the group that received CHOP plus rituximab than in the group that received CHOP alone (76 percent vs. 63 percent, P=0.005). With a median follow-up of two years, event-free and overall survival times were significantly higher in the CHOP-plus-rituximab group (P<0.001 and P=0.007, respectively). The addition of rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure and death (risk ratios, 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.77] and 0.64 [0.45 to 0.89], respectively). Clinically relevant toxicity was not significantly greater with CHOP plus rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of rituximab to the CHOP regimen increases the complete-response rate and prolongs event-free and overall survival in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, without a clinically significant increase in toxicity.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: Supported by the International Society for Translational Medicine (ISTM), Wenzhou Medical College and the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, the International Conference on Translational Medicine (ICTM) was held on October 22-23, 2011 in Wenzhou, China. Nearly 800 registrants attended the meeting, primarily representing institutes and hospitals in Europe, The United States of America, And Asia, and China. The meeting was chaired and organized by Dr. Xiangdong Wang, Xiaoming Chen, Richard Coico, Jeffrey M. Drazen, Richard Horton, Francesco M. Marincola, Laurentiu M. Popescu, Jia Qu and Aamir Shahzad. FINDINGS: The meeting focused on the communication of the need to foster translational medicine (TM) by building and broadening bridges between basic research and clinical studies at the international level. The meeting included distinguished TM experts from academia, the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries, government agencies, regulators, and clinicians and provided the opportunity to identify shared interests and efforts for collaborative approaches utilizing cutting edge technologies, innovative approaches and novel therapeutic interventions. The meeting defined the concept of TM in its two-way operational scheme and emphasized the need for bed to bench efforts based directly on clinical observation. CONCLUSIONS: It was the meeting participants' realization that the shared main goals of TM include breaking the separation between clinic practice and basic research, establishing positive feedback by understanding the basis of expected and unexpected clinical outcomes and accelerating basic research relevant to human suffering. The primary objectives of the meeting were two-fold: to accelerate the two-way translation by informing the participants representing the different disciplines about the state of art activities around TM approaches; and to identify areas that need to be supported by redirecting limited resources as well as identifying new sources of funding. This report summarizes key concepts presented during the meeting representing the state-of-art translational research and salient aspects of the ensuing discussions.},

abstract = {Cell of origin classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) identifies subsets with biological and clinical significance. Despite the established nature of the classification existing studies display variability in classifier implementation, and a comparative analysis across multiple data sets is lacking. Here we describe the validation of a cell of origin classifier for DLBCL, based on balanced voting between 4 machine-learning tools: the DLBCL automatic classifier (DAC). This shows superior survival separation for assigned Activated B-cell (ABC) and Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL classes relative to a range of other classifiers. DAC is effective on data derived from multiple microarray platforms and formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples and is parsimonious, using 20 classifier genes. We use DAC to perform a comparative analysis of gene expression in 10 data sets (2030 cases). We generate ranked meta-profiles of genes showing consistent class-association using ≥6 data sets as a cut-off: ABC (414 genes) and GCB (415 genes). The transcription factor ZBTB32 emerges as the most consistent and differentially expressed gene in ABC-DLBCL while other transcription factors such as ARID3A, BATF, and TCF4 are also amongst the 24 genes associated with this class in all datasets. Analysis of enrichment of 12323 gene signatures against meta-profiles and all data sets individually confirms consistent associations with signatures of molecular pathways, chromosomal cytobands, and transcription factor binding sites. We provide DAC as an open access Windows application, and the accompanying meta-analyses as a resource.},

@article{Bolstad2003,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},
